"Visually stunning, lacked depth"
Fantastic Beasts 3: Passable
NOTHING FELT EARNED.
WarnerBros need to do some restructuring
"Lacks the magic and awe the series deserves,"
"Still lacking a certain magic, the newest Fantastic Beasts is a step back in the right direction"
"You deserve a zero, WB! Johnny Depp carried your trilogy!"
Convoluted
"Not good, ??"
Brain Rot
Secrets of Dumb-bore
Justice for Jhonny Depp
Underwhelming movie and zero morals
Fell Asleep
Its pay back time wb
Almost left
Boring movie
The lack of intensity in the action scenes made this movie rather forgettable than rewatchable
"It puts the ""dumb"" in Dumbledore"
A gathering of missed opportunities
Bring Johnny back!
I hate you Warner Bros.
Waste of time effort and money
Verging on tedious...
Just disappointing..
