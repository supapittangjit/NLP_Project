Incredibly unique	"The Northman's combination of a large budget and epic scale with a slow burn character drama make it an incredibly unique and rare film. A disturbingly violent yet breathtakingly beautiful exploration of the cycle of violence and it's burden on those it consumes.Alexander Skarsg�rd gives a phenomenal lead performance, full of a ridiculously intense physicality balanced with a visible pain and trauma. Anya Taylor-Joy is incredible with steely eyed determination and Claes Bang is terrific, bringing depth and nuance to a possibly one note character.Robert Eggers' direction is excellent, full of satisfyingly long takes, visceral action and some truly surreal imagery. The music by Sebastian Gainsborough and Robin Carolan is perfect, skillfully switching between bombastic, haunting and beautiful."
A modern epic	"An epic film with a straightforward story and effective use of Norse mythology. Its intense rituals, powerful imagery, guttural and pounding music and display of culture in its authentic setting makes for an entertaining and memorable experience. Stunning scenery, brutal and bloody fight scenes and great acting performances, I thoroughly enjoyed it."
This film is excellent !	"Like his memorable period piece freak-outs ""The Witch"" and ""The Lighthouse,"" though on a vastly more ambitious scale, bloody and deliciously violent. The Northman is a big-budget epic, but it retains those indie roots, and in "" Robert Eggers "" fashion , very aesthetically pleasing. This film delivers ! Powerhouse performances and otherworldly imagery . I highly recommend at some point to see this blood-soaked odyssey !! Sooner rather than later. A cinematic saga. The cast in this one is absolutely incredible. Check out the cast ...."
	"The Northman starring Alexander Skarsgard, Anya Taylor-Joy, Nicole Kidman, Ethan Hawke, Willem Dafoe, and Bj�rk."
One goal/destination/plan	"Considering the trailer had the quote being said over and over again (""I will avenge you ... I will save you .. I will kill you ..."" leaving the spaces on purpose in case someone has not seen the trailer, you can find out about that in the movie then), it is a bit surprising that the grown man we see seems to have forgotten about the words he uttered over and over again as a kid.That being said, it does give another nice turning point and introduces us to an interesting and intriguing character. I am not too familiar with Vikings folklore and saga (I didn't even know much about the History behind the very good tv show Vikings), but I imagine Eggers did quite a bit of research. And I think you can tell by watching it. Even if I hadn't seen a video of him explaining one scene (the first time we see the adult version of out main character that is, on a boat), I could feel that there is a lot of authenticity in the movie.That begins with the set and production design and goes beyond that to the lighting and co..."
Beastliness incarnate	"Everything about this movie screams ""beastly."" Literal screams along with metaphorical ones. It's a beastly movie with a beastly cast giving beastly performances behind a backdrop of beastly cinematography scored with beastly music. Beastly men in beastly fights.I had a smile on my face for most of the movie. I was fully invested in the story and characters. The directing is top-notch with a style that gives the movie a character of its own. There are so many beautiful shots. And I give it major props for going all out and holding nothing back (we need more R-rated movies!!).In my review for Dune, I mentioned that so many scenes feel so epic even without action. Regular scenes of them walking are somehow epic. It's the same way with The Northman. It's filled with epic non-action moments, which are heavily aided by the music and cinematography. When this is the case, even the slow parts feel escalated.The entire cast gives great performances, but I need to single out Anya Taylor-Joy. I want her cast in ever..."
"Brutal, brooding, dank and doom enlists the film with the ranks of SPARTACUS, BRAVEHEART & GLADIATOR with a hint of Inigo Montoya's blood oath of redemption; one of the year"	"THE NORTHMAN (2022) **** Alexander Skarsgard, Nicole Kidman, Claes Bang, Ethan Hawke, Anna Taylor-Joy, Willem Dafoe, Bjork. Filmmaker Robert Eggers' tone poem take on the Viking mythos focuses on the vendetta of vengeance that Amleth (an imposing yet vulnerable Skarsgard) seeks in the murder of his king father (Hawke) at the hands of his malignant uncle that echoes Shakespeare's MacBeth in oh so many ways. Cast with an impressive array of talent including Kidman as his mother with shades of Lady MacBeth and Taylor-Joy as his kindred spirit soulmate. Beautifully shot by Jarin Blaschke and a production design by Craig Lathrop transports you back to 895 AD with on location shooting in Northern Ireland adding to its epic visage overall. Brutal, brooding, dank and doom enlists the film with the ranks of SPARTACUS, BRAVEHEART & GLADIATOR with a hint of Inigo Montoya's blood oath of redemption; one of the year's very best."
Another Eggers Classic	"As it is kind of becoming Eggers trademark, you either love or hate his movies. This one is no different.Is it a realistic viking representation? I wouldn't know I'm no expert on that area, but I don't think that is the point of the film. It is definetely not trying to be realisticly accurate.Is it slow at times, kind of weird, and brutally shocking? Yes that is an Eggers film as it core. Be aware of that.Is it a very enjoyable, compeling, emotional, dramatic and somehow fantastical film about the obsession of revenge and destiny? Yes, absolutely."
"""I will avenge you, father. I will save you, mother. I will kill you, Fj�lnir."""	"From the first frame you know that ""The Northman"" will not be an ordinary movie. Robert Eggers returns with another masterful story far removed from the horror genre (although with some present touches of this genre) and explores an epic story whose excellently written script surprises with each scene and each sometimes theatrical dialogue. The filming locations are tremendous and together with the first level cinematography, the costume design and a spectacular production they achieve a trip to the past and to the mythology of the Vikings. Eggers' film directing excels at every second and the performances are delightful, especially Nicole Kidman's, possibly the best performance of her career. The soundtrack is deep, the special effects shine from how excellent they are. ""The Northman"" is so far the best film of this 2022 and it can hardly be dethroned. Talking about this movie deserves nothing but praise, an instant classic!"
"Well Produced, but Dark, Slow and Not Engaging"	"I wanted to like this movie. I really did. Anything novel and not Marvel. But, unfortunately, this movie was dark, slow and not engaging. It started off with the harsh power of humanity to endure hardship and to impose it, but then went flat with the story. Nothing to learn, no one to love or hate, nothing to make you a character. Not intending the ultimate insult, but perhaps it is: you never forget you're watching a movie. You don't become one with it. However, it could win an Academy award for the production or costumes, but none of that makes up for a dark, slow and non-engaging story."
"Finally, an authentic viking filmatization!"	"It's intense, dark, brutal and fierce! The ultimate story about blood vengence. Unlike the Vikings show (History channel) this movie is actually pretty authentic in terms of depicting the viking culture and lifestyle. Eggers certainly has put a lot of his signature storyteliing touch on it which gives the film a unique character. Perhaps not for everybody but most people will probably find it intereating and refreshing!"
"Wow, This Was Full On Viking!"	"The NorthmanI thought it was brilliantThis movie is not for everyone due to the levels of violence and gore.It was an incredible mix of different elements that added up to an understanding of brutal Viking culture and how they may have lived. The different themes were fate, revenge, mythology and destiny.The mythological elements were handled with great panache, with highly stylised quasi dream sequences driving the chapters this could have been a disaster but here it worked in spades.There wasn't a lot of script it was all action and Alexander Skarsg�rd was perfectly cast as the cast out revenge driven son, in fact the whole movie was stuffed with stars. All I can say Nicole Kidman is wow, who'd have thunk it! The jury is still out on Claes Bang, seemed wooden and Anna Taylor-Joy, had the look, but others may be more kind!It was long at 2 hours and 16 mins, and divided into chapters in a largely linear story. It was very original and any comparison would be crass but the nearest would be The Vikings with ..."
Not just another Viking movie	"Robert Eggers does it again! This isn't just another viking movie, it is one of the BEST dramas ever! GREAT action & emotional too. A fitting end, while also setting up what's next. It is a stunning tale of betrayal and obsessive revenge. With excellent world building saturating every frame, it's one of the most transporting, magical, action-soaked films in some time. Must watch. 10/10."
Hawke The Slayer	"This might be an unpopular one, but I guess I have to speak the truth as I found it - which was that I was hoping ""The Northman"" would be a crazy, wild and brutal Viking adventure - which in some elements it is, but it's also a lyrical, arthouse-style, loose adaptation of Amleth, that perhaps caught me in the wrong mood to truly appreciate.King Aruvandil (Ethan Hawke) is a Viking King, who is murdered by his brother Fjolnir (Claes Bang) who takes his Estate and his Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman). Fjolnir fails to kill his son, Amleth (Oscar Novak/Alexander Skarsgard) though, who swears revenge as a child and after years killing and pillaging with an adopted clan, learns that Fjolnir has moved to Iceland. Infiltrating the household as a slave, Amelth joins forces with Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy) another slave in the house and his long-awaited vengeance begins.I can see why people liked it. It's beautiful to look at, shot in practical locations and using CGI to enhance the scenes when required, such as the epic vol..."
Brutal and Beautiful vikings saga	"It was finally time, Robert Eggers ""The Northman"" one of my if not the most anticipated movie of 2022 for me.I was i little bit worried that this movie wouldn't feel like a Robert Eggers movie now that there was some big companies involved in this, but boy was i wrong. The Northman feels just like a Eggers movie but with a bigger budget, and wow what a fantastic movie this was. A dark,brutal and Violent vikings tale with some incredibly beautiful shots and a Swedish viking in the lead role.The Northman feelt like a crossover betweeen The Green Knight and Gladiator and it might already be one of the best movies of the year."
An Epic Viking Revenge Movie	"This is a movie that I've been excited about. It feels like I heard about this movie a couple years ago and I'm assuming due to COVID, it got pushed back. Knowing that Robert Eggers as doing a new movie that was featuring Vikings and revenge, you had me in. The more that I heard about the cast, it piqued my interest even more. Now I got to see this early thanks to Fright Club Podcast, as they had a showing through the Focus group.We start this movie with Amleth (Oscar Novak) as a boy. He greets his father who is back from war. His father is King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) who is known as War-Raven. Amleth's mother is Queen Gudr�n (Nicole Kidman). His world is turned upside when his father is murdered and Amleth flees. Years later, he grows up in the land of Rus, having joined another group of Vikings. Amleth is now a fierce berserker. His oath to avenge his father and rescue his mother never leaving his mind. He then sets out to do so. In the process, he meets Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy) and falls in love with her..."
Long Live The King	"Robert Eggers, who watched the epic movie ""The Juniper Tree"" at the age of 14 and decided to become a director, is now a director who makes epic films. After he proved it with ""The Northman"", Robert Eggers was promoted to the side of those gods from a good regulation that follows the gods of cinema. A magnificent art direction, a unique cinematography, impressive musical scores, actors and actresses each serving a purpose..."
Robert Eggers' weakest film	"While they definitely aren't for all tastes, I was blown away by the originality and singular visions of ""The Witch"" and ""The Lighthouse,"" even if they still are so specific that I still had my criticisms of them. As a result, I was hoping for this to be a truly unique and memorable cinematic experience. Unfortunately, it looks and sounds incredible but otherwise ended up being a letdown in my book. It's certainly Eggers' weakest film yet, which is disappointing.The film centers on a Viking whose father is killed by his uncle when he is very young. Decades later, he is a berserker raiding villages who ends up plotting a bloody plot for vengeance. Shot on location in Iceland, the film's cinematography is often beautiful, with expansive and wide shots. The film's score is also stirring and authentic. Everything looks and sounds incredible in a Dolby Cinema screen, accentuated by Eggers' precise attention to historical accuracy that we see throughout his films. Tragically, though, these technical qualities ar..."
Brutal Feral Film	"If you know the story of Hamlet much of this will be familiar. Add a splash of ""Conan The Barbarian"" and you're in for a wild ride. I love revenge flicks but this one will have you a little taken back by the fact that it isn't exactly a clean situation. A boy sees his entire family sacked and takes to fates and a mantra of exacting revenge to dole out his justice and regain his birthright. However as he gets closer to the truth our perception flips due to complex dynamics. Honor, betrayal and deep seeded anger drive Amleth (Alexander Skaarsgard) which has moments of redemption but a wild feral man consumed by violence knows not a peaceful life. I found myself leaning into the mythical tale. Grounded by the rawness of the feudal society. You will get that visceral pain which a blade of steel runs through human flesh. This has the bruality of ""Excalibur"" as well. Director Robert Eggers thrives in swampy worlds. The lyrically ugly nature of humans in the wild. Everyone's just trying to survive. I pity anyone ..."
I heard moaning in the theater	"The Northman is a match made in Heaven that has ventured through Hel and Niflheim to reach us. 'Tis a masterwork of grit and violence that is also contemplative and beautiful; a surely crowd-pleasing action film that can also be unmistakably discerned as the work of modern genius Robert Eggers.In the film, Eggers captures the beauty and brutality of Nordic folklore -- from the snarling intensity of Alexander Skarsg�rd to the ethereal mysticism of Bj�rk as The Seeress (plus a far better usage of Iceland as a shooting location than last year's Lamb). What might turn some people off, even those at my local theater who will watch anything with a half-naked Skarsg�rd family member in it, is the story, which is ""Hamlet all over again"" to anyone who doesn't know just where Shakespeare got the idea for his most mimicked play.When a movie is based on a tale that has inspired countless others, causing many a newbie to mislabel the film ""unoriginal"", I usually bring up the John Carter Effect, which I might now need t..."
Greatest film of the year	The Northman is unlike anything that has been released this year. Anya Taylor Joy killed it once again in her role. The whole cast was spectacular. I left the theater with my jaw hanging it was unbelievable. I thought I was on the set of this movie that's how real this felt. The last time I saw anything this good was last months The Batman.This movie is a must see film for any history buff or really anyone. The fight scenes are some of the best and most brutal that I have ever seen I thought I was going to get sick they were that good. I hope the Oscars remember this movie because this should win some awards.11/10.
