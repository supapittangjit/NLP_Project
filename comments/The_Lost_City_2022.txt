silly and formulaic by design
"Simple, fun, hilarious...."
Pieces that work and pieces that don't
Cute and funny enough
Enjoyable and amusing
"A Solid, Throwback Comedy"
Needs more Brad Pitt
Good fun.
Moving on
Very fun despite some of the ridiculous bits
A little bit of substance to add to the formula
Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum amazingly click
An enjoyable knockoff of Indiana Jones et al. Romantic and goofy.
Way funnier than i thought it was going to be
Not your typical RomCom!
Hilarious!
A nice and fun movie - exactly what I wanted!
More Brad
Fun popcorn movie that doesn't take itself seriously
VIEWS ON FILM review of The Lost City
Great duo and fun adventure but forgettable plot and thin amount of humor makes it decent.
Great comedy adventure
Surprised
The Action and Adventure Seem Lost In This Film For Me
Truly a waste of time and talent
