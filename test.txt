I remember the 'Death on the Nile' with Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot. I am assuming the story and reveal is the same, so I don't see the point in watching a rehash of an already excellent movie.
Watched it last week. It was forgettably dull and disappointing. "SHOW don't TELL" is the #1 rule that governs how good or bad a movie is yet it seems to be the hardest rule for movies to follow. Unfortunately, Death on the Nile spends too much time TELLING the audience what they need to know instead of SHOWING them, especially in the setup. The biggest thing this lets down is the characters. You don't feel connected to them. You don't care for them. You know nothing about them except what the dialogue shoves in your face. Overall, this was a big disappointed when compared to its predecessor which I actually really enjoyed.
Kenneth Branagh is ruining Hercule Poirot. Another great cast; another dull movie. David Suchet has done a much better job on these films.
A solid 6, I only wish they stopped casting Gal Gadot, she is such a bad actress...
Had potential to be a really good movie but they drag it along and it becomes quickly predictable and boring at times. The acting was sub par and slightly over done. I would not watch it again.
